Quality of life updates to the Pro version of Meme Search, including:

- bugfixes in the image-to-text service that makes cancelling failed jobs more reliable
- new custom ports / hosts options to more easily run the pro app with tools like Unraid and Portainer, or if you need to run its services on different ports / hosts
- new local build compose file for building and testing locally `docker-compose-pro-local-build.yml`
- new `grid view` in both home and search pages for a broader view of your memes (see animation below)

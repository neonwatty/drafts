# What My Project Does

The open source engine indexes your memes by their visual content and text, making them easily searchable. Drag and drop recovered memes into any messager.

Thanks to community feedback, we're excited to release a major update, featuring quality-of-life improvements, new image-to-text models, UX enhancements, and local build/test upgrades!   These include:

- 4 new [image to text new models](https://github.com/neonwatty/meme-search?tab=readme-ov-file#features---pro-version)  ranging in size from 200M to 2B parameters enabling much faster local processing on most machines
- 10x reduction in Docker image size for app services
- Easier custom setup of the for local NAS, Portainer, Unraid, etc., 
use with newly enabled [customize hosts names and ports](https://github.com/neonwatty/meme-search/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#custom-hosts-and-ports) 
- new model selection panel added in Settings allowing for choice of image-to-text model at will
- new `grid view` added to both home and search pages for a broader view of your memes

# Target Audience

This is a toy project. Open source and made for fun.

# Comparison

* immich: great open source image organizer
* other local photo apps: some allow for indexing but not quite at the level of a vlm yet

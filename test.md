Hey, I’m Jeremy — an AI engineer focused on agentic systems and product-facing AI.  I’m especially excited by how these technologies unlock untapped markets, and I've spent a lot of time building and testing ideas in that space.  I’ve got a PhD in AI, a BA in Religious Studies, and I've completed a few side quests — like writing a university ML textbook, getting HVAC certified, and training as a CrossFit athlete.

For over a decade, I’ve worked with and led machine learning and product teams across generative AI, deep learning, and large-scale infrastructure.  I focus on turning cutting-edge research and rough tooling into real-world systems — especially around agentic workflows, model deployment, and AI-driven product development.  I’m drawn to work that’s technically deep and built for impact.

That's why I'm stoked to be joining SmithRx!

Hey, I’m Jeremy — an AI engineer focused on agentic systems and product-facing AI.  I’m super excited by how these technologies unlock untapped markets, and I've spent a lot of time building and testing ideas in that space.   I’ve got a PhD in AI, a BA in Religious Studies, and I've completed a few side quests along the way — like writing a university ML textbook, getting HVAC certified, and training as a CrossFit athlete.

For over a decade, I’ve worked with and led ML and product teams across generative AI, deep learning, and large-scale infrastructure.  I focus on turning novel research and rough tooling into real-world systems that solve real painful problems.  I’m drawn to work that’s technically deep and built for impact.

That’s why I’m stoked to be joining SmithRx! It’s a rare opportunity to apply AI in a space that’s both deeply complex and deeply meaningful.  From smarter medication routing to better pricing intelligence, there’s a ton of potential to build systems that are not just technically ambitious, but also improve real lives.   Can’t wait to dive in.

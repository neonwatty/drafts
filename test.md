Hey, I’m Jeremy — an AI engineer focused on agentic systems and product-facing AI. I’m especially interested in how these technologies unlock untapped markets, and I've spent a lot of time building and testing ideas in that space. I’ve got a PhD in AI, a BA in Religious Studies, and I've completed a few side quests — like writing a widely used ML textbook, getting HVAC certified, and training as a CrossFit athlete.

For over a decade, I’ve led machine learning and product teams across generative AI, deep learning, and large-scale infrastructure. I focus on turning cutting-edge research into real-world systems — especially around agentic workflows, model deployment, and AI-driven product development. I’m drawn to work that’s technically deep and built for impact.

That's why I'm stoked to be joining SmithRx!

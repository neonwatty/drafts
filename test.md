Hey, I’m Jeremy — an AI engineer focused on agentic systems and product-facing AI.  I’m super excited by how these technologies unlock untapped markets, and I've spent a lot of time building and testing ideas in that space.   I’ve got a PhD in AI, a BA in Religious Studies, and I've completed a few side quests along the way — like writing a university ML textbook, getting HVAC certified, and training as a CrossFit athlete.

For over a decade, I’ve led ML and product teams across generative AI, deep learning, and large-scale infrastructure — turning novel research and scrappy tooling into real-world systems that solve real, painful problems.  That’s why I’m stoked to be joining SmithRx: it’s a rare chance to apply AI in a space that’s both technically challenging and genuinely meaningful.  From improving access and transparency to helping people get the care they need more affordably, there’s a ton of potential to build systems that make a real impact.   

Can’t wait to get started!

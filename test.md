Thanks to community feedback, we're excited to release a major update, featuring quality-of-life improvements, new image-to-text models, UX enhancements, and local build/test upgrades!   

Some of these updates include:

- 4 new [image to text new models](https://github.com/neonwatty/meme-search?tab=readme-ov-file#features---pro-version)  ranging in size from 200M to 2B parameters enabling much faster local processing on most machines
- 10x reduction in Docker image size for app services
- Easier custom setup of the for local NAS, Portainer, Unraid, etc., 
use with newly enabled [customize hosts names and ports](https://github.com/neonwatty/meme-search/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#custom-hosts-and-ports) 
- new model selection panel added in Settings allowing for choice of image-to-text model at will
- new `grid view` added to both home and search pages for a broader view of your memes
